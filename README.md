# smartCar
The smart car is a system that integrates sensing and comprehensive environment, planning and decision-making, and multi-level assisted driving control. It adopts computer, modern, automatic information integration, communication, artificial intelligence and other technologies. It is a typical high-tech vehicle research. It is mainly used to improve the comprehensiveness, comfort and humanized application interface of automobiles. And the hotspots of smart car research in the world, smart engineering and automotive field. New power, many of which will be fully integrated into the intelligent systems of their respective key development
